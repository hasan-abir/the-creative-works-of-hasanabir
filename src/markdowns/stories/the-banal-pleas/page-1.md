Both feet sank and cloaked in the ground. The coolness of the
mud sent signals of tranquility. But the encompassing
transformation of liquid mud into solid concrete, brought panic.
Only a few steps away, from what looked like a barn. In the shed, in
the shade. In it and in the center, plenty of figures moved about in
plenty of limbs, obscured in the bloom of the sun. Warm hearts. In
eagerness to inch closer, a leg plopped a step. Then the other. Fence
gates that looked open two feet away, were then chained on
approach. Not a thing to have done about that. But from there, it
was clear that there were goats in the center. Speckled with whites,
the black and the brown mammals could only wander so far before
being pulled back by the rope and the pole that they were tied to. A
sudden clench felt at the floor. Surrounding, it was only concrete
then. No way of an escape if one considered. From one of the
corners of the barn, an unknown man in silhouette entered with
pulsating boiling blood; heavy in his presence with a freshly
sharpened machete in his hand. Vigorous too, told by his wicked
stomps. He walked towards the gullible beings with all his
attention. They were seemingly unchanged for the most part, until
the man placed his feet right against theirs. Then he raised his
blade high aloft rather slowly. Took a deep breath that he let out
with the slow descent of his weapon.

—Quick! Heart can’t contain to see it all happen! Turn around,
shut your eyes and sit on the ground, words that never came to
mouth but orderly followed.

Oh, that wailing! What a miserable way of going out! The sounds of
squishy meat split by sharp edges only brought squeamishness.
Then one after another, age old memories revealed themselves. Just
like the passing train, the falling rain, all very faint. Wrathful
visions of the unsought came, leaving a great taint.
